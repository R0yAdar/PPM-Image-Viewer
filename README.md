# PPM-Image-Viewer
I needed a ppm image viewer for this C++ Ray Tracing toturial:
(https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview), 
but I couldn't find any decent one, so I created this one using PyQt6...
It's really simple, and it only supports showing images at 
the moment with no intention of higher level functions like
scaling, etc.

There's an .exe for windows x64.
